    "As we go on about our daily commutes in the morning and afternoon. the amount of traffic is a big factor that determines how much time we spend on traveling. Even if you are simply walking to school or work, the concurrent traffic will decide how long you need to wait at traffic lights. You might know that traffic congestion is a big problem in densely populated citys, for example, LA. Also, traffic congestion increases vehicle emissions which degrades the air quality. Thus, I think low volume of traffic is a good indicator for finding the best neighborhoods in Pittsbugrh. I'll be using the average daily car traffic count of a neighborhood to determine its overall level of traffic."
